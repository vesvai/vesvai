		Paragraph("Modern AI coding tools converge on a simple idea: give the agent a single, well-structured Markdown file that explains how your repo \"works,\" and prepend that file to every LLM call so the agent never has to guess about architecture, commands, or conventions. Community gists, RFCs, and vendor playbooks all recommend the same core sections\u2014overview, project map, build/test scripts, code style, security, and other relevant information. This file is intended to be that single source of truth for Vesvai.").

			"Commands that will be commonly used, such as how to build, lint, and run tests. Include the necessary commands to develop in this codebase, such as how to run a single test.",

		Paragraph("Usage Notes:").
		List(
			"If there's already a AGENTS.md, suggest improvements to it.",
			"When you make the initial AGENTS.md, do not repeat yourself and do not include obvious instructions like \"Provide helpful error messages to users\", \"Write unit tests for all new utilities\", \"Never include sensitive information (API keys, tokens) in code or commits\".",
			"Avoid listing every component or file structure that can be easily discovered.",
			"Don't include generic development practices.",
			"If there are Cursor rules (in .cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules) or Copilot rules (in .github/copilot-instructions.md), make sure to include the important parts.",
			"If there is a README.md, make sure to include the important parts.",
			"Do not make up information such as \"Common Development Tasks\", \"Tips for Development\", \"Support and Documentation\" unless this is expressly included in other files that you read.",

			"Architecture Notes \u2013 high-level diagram in Mermaid **or** ASCII plus a prose explanation of major components and data flow.",
