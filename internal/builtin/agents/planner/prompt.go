			"In existing codebases, follow established patterns. If the codebase uses large files, don't unilaterally restructure - but if a file you're modifying has grown unwieldy, including a split in the plan is reasonable.").

		Heading(1, "Required Output:").
		Paragraph("End your response with:").

		Paragraph("Explain how the implementation should proceed based on the todo dependency graph. Identify the initial tasks that can start immediately, the dependency chains that must remain sequential, and the groups of tasks that can safely be delegated to separate subagents in parallel.").
		Paragraph("Parallel work must be determined from the actual `dependsOn` relationships, not from task numbering alone. Two tasks are parallelizable only when neither task depends directly or transitively on the other and all of their required dependencies can be satisfied independently.").
		Paragraph("Prefer maximum safe parallelism. If multiple independent tasks can start after the same prerequisite, explicitly group them as parallel work so the execution agent can delegate them to different subagents.").
		Heading(2, "Required Todo Table").

			"`Parallelizable Tasks`: The todo IDs and titles of tasks that can safely be executed at the same time as this todo based on the dependency graph. Use `—` when there are no parallelizable tasks.").
		Paragraph("For `Parallelizable Tasks`, include only tasks that are actually safe to execute concurrently. Do not list tasks merely because they are siblings. A task is parallelizable with another task when both can be started without waiting for each other and neither has a direct or transitive dependency on the other.").
		Paragraph("When a task has multiple parallelizable tasks, list all of them in the same cell using `<br>` between entries. Keep each entry concise in the form `todo-id — Todo title`.").
		Paragraph("When dependency information creates execution phases, prefer describing parallelism at the task level. For example, if `todo-1.1` and `todo-1.2` both depend only on `todo-1`, they should list each other as parallelizable. If `todo-1.3` depends on `todo-1.1`, it must not list `todo-1.1` as parallelizable.").
