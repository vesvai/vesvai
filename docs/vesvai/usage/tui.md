# TUI

The terminal UI is the default way to use Vesvai. Launch it with `vesvai` on a
terminal, or explicitly with `vesvai tui`.

```

- **Chat transcript** — user cards, assistant markdown, thinking blocks, tool cards,
  and subagent cards. With an empty chat, an animated Vesvai logo is shown.
- **Attachment bar** — appears only when files are attached.
- **Input editor** — up to 6 rows tall, with inline chips for skills, mentions, and
  long pasted text.
- **Status bar** — a running indicator (`●`), the active model as
  `name/provider`, reasoning effort when set, context usage, session cost, and a
  `Ctrl+P` hint.
- **Hint line** — transient errors and the `Press Esc to interrupt` hint.

## Global keys

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| ++ctrl+c++ / ++ctrl+q++ | Quit |
| ++ctrl+t++ | Cycle to the next theme (saved to config) |
| ++ctrl+p++ | Open Settings |
| ++esc++ | Interrupt (see below) |
| ++tab++ | Cycle focus: input → attachments → chat → input |
| Mouse wheel | Scroll the chat 3 lines |
| Mouse click | Activate the item under the cursor |

### Interrupting the agent

While a run is active, pressing ++esc++ once shows *Press Esc to interrupt*.
Pressing ++esc++ again within **2 seconds** cancels the run and all subagents.
Pressing it once and waiting lets the run continue.

When the chat has focus, ++esc++ returns focus to the input. While viewing a
subagent transcript, ++esc++ goes back to the main chat.

## Input editor

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| ++enter++ | Submit |
| ++shift+enter++ | Insert newline |
| ++tab++ | Insert a tab character |
| ++left++ / ++right++ / ++up++ / ++down++ | Move the cursor (word-wrap aware) |
| ++home++ / ++end++ | Start / end of line |
| ++ctrl+left++ / ++ctrl+right++ | Word left / right |
| ++alt+left++ / ++alt+right++ | Word left / right |
| ++ctrl+a++ | Select all |
| ++ctrl+e++ | End of line |
| ++ctrl+k++ / ++ctrl+u++ | Delete to end / start |
| ++ctrl+w++ / ++alt+backspace++ | Delete word |
| ++ctrl+d++ | Delete character forward |
| ++ctrl+y++ | Paste from the kill ring |
| ++ctrl+z++ / ++ctrl+shift+z++ | Undo / redo (200 steps) |
| ++ctrl+shift+k++ | Delete line |
| ++ctrl+shift+up++ / ++ctrl+shift+down++ | Move line up / down |
| ++shift+arrows++ | Extend selection |

Skills (`/name`), mentions (`@name`), and long pasted text are atomic **chips**:
cursor movement and deletion treat each chip as a single unit.

## Skills and mentions

Type `/` at the start of a word to open the **skill picker**, or `@` to open the
**mention picker**. Both are fuzzy-filtered as you type.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| ++up++ / ++down++ | Move the selection |
| ++enter++ / ++tab++ | Accept the selected item |
| ++esc++ | Dismiss |
| ++space++ | Dismiss and keep typing |

- `/skill` inserts a skill chip that is expanded to the skill's instructions before
  the message reaches the model. See [Skills](../configurations/skills.md).
- `@name` inserts a mention chip for an agent, file, folder, or attachment. Mentions
  are sent to the model as literal `@name` text for it to interpret. See
  [Adding Context](../features/adding-context.md).

## Pasting and attachments

There is no system-clipboard integration; pasting uses the terminal's bracketed
paste. When you paste:

- A single line that is an existing file path is attached as a file.
- In a multi-line paste, every line that is an existing file path is attached.
- Text longer than 100 characters is inserted as a collapsible **long text** chip.

Attachments appear in the attachment bar with type icons (image, audio, file) and
pagination dots. Focus the bar with ++tab++, navigate with ++left++/++right++, and
remove with ++backspace++ or ++delete++.

Image and audio attachments are rejected if the active model's metadata does not
list that input modality.

## Chat items

| Item | Rendering |
|---|---|
| User message | Boxed card, with attachment chips |
| Assistant message | Rendered markdown (headings, lists, quotes, inline styles) |
| Thinking | Collapsible; animated while active, raw reasoning when expanded |
| Tool call | Card with name, enriched target (`read:path`, `bash:cmd`, ...), duration, expandable output |
| Subagent | Card with status, live activity line, output preview, usage, and a **History** action |
| Error | Bold red `✖ error: ...` |

### Specialized tool cards

- **BASH** — command header, syntax-highlighted output (30 lines collapsed),
  `exit code` footer.
- **DIFF** — unified diff for `edit` calls with added/removed highlighting and a
  `+N -M` summary.
- **WRITE** — syntax-highlighted file content for `write` calls.
- **TODO** — parsed todo list with status icons and an `N / M completed` footer.
- **ASK** — question/answer pairs collected from the user.

Fenced code in assistant messages is syntax-highlighted for Go, TypeScript,
JavaScript, Python, Rust, Bash, C/C++, Ruby, PHP, Swift, Kotlin, Scala, Elixir,
Haskell, CSS, HTML, JSON, YAML, Markdown, SQL, R, Lua, and Dart.

### Tool card keys

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| ++enter++ / ++space++ | Expand or collapse the selected item |
| `]` / `[` | Next / previous item |
| ++up++ / ++down++ | Scroll one line |
| ++pgup++ / ++pgdn++ | Scroll one page |
| ++home++ / ++end++ | Jump to top / bottom |

## Subagents

Running and finished subagents appear as cards in the main transcript. Select a
running subagent and press ++enter++, or click **History**, to open its live
transcript. Press ++esc++ or click the back header to return. See
[Subagents](../features/subagents.md).

## Settings

Open with ++ctrl+p++. The overlay has eight tabs; switch with ++left++/++right++ when
the tab bar is focused. Press ++down++ to enter the tab content, ++up++ to return to
the tab bar.

| Tab | Contents |
|---|---|
| **General** | Provider (add or reconfigure), Model (searchable list), Theme, Reasoning effort |
| **Session** | Load/New/Delete session, Change title, Compaction settings |
| **MCP** | Connected MCP servers and their tools |
| **Skills** | Loaded skills with descriptions |
| **Rules** | Global and project rule files |
| **Plugins** | Installed plugins with enable/disable toggle |
| **Permissions** | Preset selector and per-tool permission modes |
| **System** | App name, version, OS, architecture, and manual update check |

- **Provider** — configure an existing provider again or add a new one by pasting an
  API key into a masked field.
- **Model** — type to filter; the active model is marked with `●`.
- **Reasoning** — available only for models that advertise reasoning options.
- **Session → Load** — sessions from the current directory, newest first. Loading
  restores the last 50 messages; scrolling to the top loads older messages in
  batches of 50.
- **Session → Delete** — asks for confirmation before permanently removing the
  session.
- **Session → Change title** — edit the generated session title.
- **Session → Compaction** — configure context compaction (see below).

### Compaction settings

Below the session management rows, the Session tab includes compaction configuration.
Navigate to a row with ++up++/++down++. Toggle switches (Enabled and the strategy
checkboxes) with ++enter++ or ++left++/++right++; adjust numeric values with
++left++/++right++:

| Setting | Values | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Enabled** | on / off | Master toggle for compaction (Enter or arrows) |
| **`[x] tool-clearing`** | checkbox | Truncate oversized tool outputs (multiple strategies can be active) |
| **`[x] sliding-window`** | checkbox | Drop older messages past the threshold |
| **`[ ] summarization`** | checkbox | Summarize history with a dedicated LLM call |
| **Threshold** | 10%–100% (step 5) | Context usage % that triggers compaction |
| **Max messages** | 5–200 (step 5) | Messages kept in sliding-window mode |
| **Max tool output** | 500–20000 chars (step 500) | Truncation limit for tool output |

Strategies are independent checkboxes: any combination is allowed, including none
(compaction then does nothing until a strategy is re-enabled).

Changes save immediately to `~/.vesvai/vesvai.json`.

### Compaction persistence

Compaction does not destroy your history. When the context is compacted, the
compacted messages are saved to a **new session linked to the current one**, forming
a chain. The original session keeps every message it had; the newest session in the
chain holds the compacted view plus everything said afterwards.

- Loading a session always opens the **newest session in its chain** — you see the
  latest compacted conversation first.
- Scrolling to the top of the transcript loads the earlier (pre-compaction)
  conversation, marked with an `─ context compacted ─` divider, and keeps
  walking back through the chain as you continue scrolling.
- Resuming a session re-applies compaction to the loaded history (sliding-window
  and tool-clearing), so resumed conversations stay within the context budget.
- While chatting, a compacted run shows a `↻ Context compacted (...)` item in the
  transcript.

### Permissions tab

The Permissions tab has its own internal navigation. When focused on the tab bar,
++left++/++right++ switches tabs. Press ++down++ to enter the presets, ++down++ again
to reach the tool list. In the tool list, ++left++/++right++ cycles the permission
mode for the selected tool. ++up++ from presets returns to the tab bar.

### System tab

The System tab displays application information (name, version, OS, architecture) and
a **Check for updates** button. Navigate to the button with ++down++ and press
++enter++ to check for a newer version. Status messages appear below the button:
"Checking...", "Already up to date", or an error. If an update is available, the
update modal opens automatically.

## Themes

Vesvai ships 26 themes: `dark` (default), `light`, `dracula`, `catppuccin-mocha`,
`catppuccin-latte`, `catppuccin-frappe`, `catppuccin-macchiato`,
`tokyonight-storm`, `tokyonight-night`, `tokyonight-day`, `gruvbox-dark`,
`gruvbox-light`, `nord`, `onedark`, `solarized-dark`, `solarized-light`,
`rosepine`, `rosepine-moon`, `rosepine-dawn`, `monokai`, `monokai-night`,
`monokai-spectrum`, `kanagawa`, `kanagawa-dragon`, `everforest-dark`, and
`everforest-light`.

Press ++ctrl+t++ to cycle themes alphabetically, or pick one in
Settings → General → Theme. The choice is saved to the `theme` key in
`~/.vesvai/vesvai.json`.

## Notifications

- **Update modal** — shown at startup when a newer release exists, with
  *Update* / *Later* buttons (++left++/++right++ to choose, ++enter++ to confirm,
  ++esc++ to skip).
- **Errors** — appended to the transcript or shown on the hint line.
- **Transient messages** — retry progress (`Request failed ... retrying in Xs`) and
  the Esc interrupt hint appear above the status bar.

## Session behavior

Each submitted message resumes the active session; if none is active, one is created
automatically and titled by a background model call. See
[Sessions](../features/sessions.md).

## Limitations

- No system clipboard copy/paste — use the terminal's own selection.
- No session fork or revert from the UI (available programmatically via the
  [SDK](../../sdk/sessions.md)).
- No command palette; Settings (++ctrl+p++) and the inline `/` and `@` pickers cover
  the same ground.
